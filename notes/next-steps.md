- `products` - Products with open-source features
- `rewards` - Reward tiers for campaigns

## Technical Implementation Notes

**Authentication Pattern:**
```typescript
// All routes should follow this pattern:
export async function loader({ request, context }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  const db = getDB(context);
  const kv = getKV(context);
  const authService = createAuthService(db, kv);
  const user = await requireAuth(request, authService);
  // ... rest of loader
}
```

**Database Field Names:**
- Use `avatar_url` (not `photo_url`)
- Use `maker_name` for username
- Use `display_name` for full name/brand

**Video Processing:**
- Users paste plain YouTube URLs
- `parseVideoUrl()` generates embed codes automatically
- Stored in `hero_video_url`, `hero_video_embed`, `hero_video_thumbnail`

## Suggested Implementation Order

1. **Start with Campaign Creation** - Core feature that makers need
2. **Add Product Management** - Allow products to be added to campaigns
3. **Build Public Views** - Campaign detail pages for visitors
4. **Add Backing System** - Allow users to commit to campaigns

## Files to Update

**Routes to add to `app/routes.ts`:**
```typescript
// Campaign routes
route("campaigns", "routes/campaigns._index.tsx"),
route("campaigns/create", "routes/campaigns.create.tsx"),
route("campaigns/:slug", "routes/campaigns.$slug.tsx"),
route("campaigns/:id/edit", "routes/campaigns.$id.edit.tsx"),

// Profile campaign management
route("profile/campaigns", "routes/profile.campaigns.tsx"),
